Avalanche forecasting using machine learning

Description:
The word Avalanche refers to snow and ice. It means a mass of snow, ice, rocks, slush falling rapidly down a mountain. Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. Each year avalanche kills more than 150 people worldwide. The most common cause of death by avalanche is asphyxiation. If the person buried under an avalanche more than 15 minutes then there is no chance of survive. So, the life of the people in that region is difficult to live.


Solution:
This project prevent the people from the avalanche by priory informing them there is a chance to the occurrence of avalanche or not. The model gets the data from the IOT based sensors. After that we want to process those data using a suitable algorithm, then our model display whether the avalanche occur or not and how strength it was. To analyse the  data coming from different sensors we are applying various machine learning algorithms. If there is a chance of  avalanche then the notification will be sent to people  so that they can take decisions accordingly.
